          <p>Nvidia provides many Software Development Kits (SDKs) that simplify any new engineer's interactions with GPUs. It is leaps and bounds above its competitors AMD and Intel in providing resources to hobbyists or individual engineers. (Nevertheless, all three companies actively engage in collaborations with universities and other corporations). SDKs are like coding libraries but designed to specifically suit the capabilities of an Nvidia system.</p>

          <p>The JetPack SDK is probably the best place to start when approaching a new Nvidia system. It allows new users to set up their embedded devices with an operating system and proprietary software [5]. NVIDIA Jetpack is an SDK package equipped with several tools to assist in the building of AI applications, providing support to the AGX Xavier, TX2, TX1, and Jetson Nano. It is also referred to as the Nvidia SDK Manager.</p>

          <p>The Nvidia SDK Manager requires two hardware components. First, the user must have a host computer running Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04, a working Internet connection, and a Jetson device [5]. The host device must have a minimum of 40GB of free disk space whereas the Jetson must have at least 25GB of free disk space. Once a USB 2.0 connection has been established between the two devices, the Jetson can be easily set up with the host computer. </p>

          <p>The SDK has a GUI which guides the user on setting up the Jetson as well as any additional packages that need to be installed [6]. This is the only way to put an operating system onto the Jetson. The SDK manager can be used later to update the SDK installation on the system [7].</p>

          <p>Next, we will explore some other SDKs that Nvidia provides. These SDKs should give you a general idea of the various high-level applications that can be tackled using a GPU.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Deepstream SDK</h2>

          <p>The DeepStreak SDK is a computer-vision library that includes AI-based video processing with sensor processing. Deepstream relies on the Gstreamer paradigm for multimedia processing [8]. DeepStream is free of charge and downloadable from the Nvidia website. Be sure to consult the Nvidia website for the various compatibility requirements of each version of DeepStream [9].</p>

          <p>DeepStream can be installed via Jetpack and comes with several demos to get an individual started on coding for machine learning and computer vision applications [10]. On a device that is set up, DeepStream can be installed via Ubuntu command “sudo apt-get”, if it was not installed via the SDK.</p>

          <p>Nvidia DeepStream SDK is an important component of NVIDIA Metropolis, which has one of its applications collection vehicle taxes in Jakarta [10]. In the past, it has also been found on Tesla cars [11]. Many of the sample applications associated with this SDK are designed to run on self-driving cars [12].</p>
          
          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Isaac SDK</h2>

          <p>The Isaac SDK is developed to support the control of mobile robots [14]. It has a structure similar to that of ROS with support for visualization, simulation, and more. The Isaac SDK is fundamentally based on the Isaac Robot Engine with support for a variety of math-planning and visualization algorithms [15]. Simulation is a key stage in robotics design and a critical component to prevent product failures [16]. The SDK package also includes tutorials for several basic packages controlling existing robots, such as the Kaya.  </p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
