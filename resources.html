        <p>Most projects will require individuals to consult a number of resources to obtain the knowledge needed to develop the 
           end product. This purpose of this page is to provide a general overview of the existing documentation, research, and 
           databases. At the end, there will be an overview of major areas of ECE research associated with GPUs and links to the
           webpages of several researchers. </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-heading">General State of Documentation</h2>
        <p>There are a number of valuable online resources worth consulting in learning more about GPUs. Some great sources to consult 
            are other projects, documentation from Nvidia and AMD, as well as other relevant groups. Unfortunately, due to dominance of 
            graphics in applications, there are few textbooks targeted at ECE majors. Furthermore, the fast rate of change in the field
            make textbooks unideal. For example, a number of the CUDA books on the market are targeted at outdated versions of CUDA. </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-heading">Textbooks</h2>
          <p>There are several GPU textbooks on the market. This section go over the application specific ones. There is one Nvidia
            sponsored titled GPGPU Gems, though for the most part, this is targetted at game graphics programmers. It is still a 
            valuable source, but perhaps daunting for beginners. Finally, due to the rapidly changes common to this field, a number
            of good resources are to be found in online documentation, rather than in published textbooks. Furthermore, Nvidia hosts a 
            active and well-mantained forum.</p> 
        
        <p>There are number of GPGPU books on the market, includng Suyata's <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~levoy/"><i>GPU Parallel 
        Program Development Using CUDA</i></a> is more focused on the architectural level. Nvidia also has a book titled GPU Gems, though 
          this is targeted more towards programmers, particularly in the graphics field There are number of CUDA books on the </p> Here is 
        brief sampling of options. The best approach would probably to consult a textbook for theory and then to rely on the most 
        up-to-date documentation on the web for coding purposes.</p>

           <p> In addition to textbooks, several shools offer coursework in the area of GPU architecture and GPGPU programming. These
