          <p>The GPU is a much more powerful processor as it breaks down the most complex calculations and finds solutions through the process of parallel processing. Because of the need to go through a lot of data while doing calculations, the GPUs have a faster and more advanced memory interface in comparison with a CPU. 
          <h1>GPU TYPES</h1>
		  <p>There are different types of GPU available to users today and users can select the GPU that they want, depending on the purpose of work.</p>
			<p> <h2 class="subheading">Integrated vs Discrete graphics</h2>
			<span class="meta">Integrated graphic card is a computer that has the GPU built onto the same component as the CPU. The benefit of this means that the CPU is small, energy efficient and low cost. The integrated graphics shares memory with the main memory of the system to balance performance and efficiency. It can be found in most modern processors. A discrete graphic card is a hardware that manages the graphical performance of a computer. They are powerful enough for any task and unlike the integrated graphic card, they don't share memory with the system making them easy to upgrade. Because of their outstanding records, the discrete graphic cards generate more heat, are expensive and larger.</span> </p>
			<h2 class="subheading">Single vs Multi GPU</h2>
            <span class="meta">Single GPU is the basic configuration GPU for standard users like gamers, video editors, home office users as it has HD resolutions with playable frame rates. Single GPU is a good value and has plenty of power needed for standard users. It has very efficient cooler operations and it's quieter than others multi-GPU configurations. Multi-GPU configuration is more specific to getting the best out of a specific task. It provides better frame rates and it is a higher powered card compared to a single GPU. The benefit of using a multi-GPU is that it “ Increased graphic performance and benchmarks especially at high resolutions or 4K. Preferable for multi-monitor gaming.”. Multi GPU requires more power and it being more expensive doesn’t necessarily mean that the performance will match the cost. Compared with a single GPU, multi-GPU has a lot more noise and produces more heat; it’s frame rates are a lot faster to identify with the eyes.</span>
		  
		  <p> <H1>GPU Comparisons: NVIDIA AMD</H1> 
		  <p>NVIDIA and AMD are compatible with any processors. To have a well design system, make sure that the processor is powerful enough to keep up with the GPU you are selecting</p>
		 	  <h2 class="subheading">Stream Processor/Cores</h2>
		  <span class="meta">The GPUs have many small cores known as stream processors. Compared to a CPU(1 to 8 cores), these stream processors have less computer power. Though the GPUs cores have less computing power, they make up for it by using their numbers and working together to process data more effectively, improving the graphical performance. NVIDIA creates fewer, more capable stream processors that allows for more complex calculations making them excellent for use in data processing. By increasing the numbers, AMD creates smaller stream processors that are less complex and they are excellent for tasks that require repetitive calculations to be performed many times.</span>

		  <H1>Hardware differences between GPUs and CPUs</H1>
		  
		  <p>Unlike a CPU, a GPU has many cores, sometimes in the hundreds, even up to the thousands, allowing for far more actions to be completed at the same time. GPUs are also well-versed in completing the same task repetitively relatively quickly. However, GPUs have far fewer actions that they can complete, often boiling down to the simplest of tasks. Examples of tasks where GPUs are preferred include Machine Learning, large data processing, and Bitcoin mining.</p>

          <img src="img/GPU_Architecture.png" alt="Block diagram of the hardware of a CPU" height="250" width="275">
            
          <p>As can be seen in the images above, GPUs and CPUs have different architectures to fit their differing roles. Generally, GPUs have only one I/O port, referred to as the PCI, while the CPU has separate I/O ports. The CPU also outputs from the CPU itself, while the GPU’s PCI port is linked directly to the memory registers. As previously stated, GPUs also have more cores than CPUs, to allow for more tasks to be completed at once. A GPU also relies on a host to handle all I/O, as well as to provide its instructions, while a CPU takes in the instructions directly, and will likely be the GPU's host in the first place.</p>
          
          <H1>How does a GPU handle an image?</H1>
          
          <img src="img/GPGPU_Flowchart.png" alt="Diagram of how a GPGPU translates a video onto a screen">
            
          <p>The above image shows how a GPU translates a video file into an video that is shown on the screen, following the Gaussian Method.</p>
          
          <p>It starts by receiving the frame data from the host. It then detects the Gaussian distributions of variables within the frame, as well as any necessary data about these distributions. Then, it quickly calculates the initial variance and weight of the frame, as well as the maximum possible number of variances. Once these calculations are complete, it's able to use a
