<h1>Introduction to Git</h1>

Git is a software development tool that allows for the tracking of changes to files. It is the base code that GitHub itself runs on. As such, understanding it is important to understanding GitHub as a whole. This section of the ReadMe will serve as a basic tutorial for the Git command line. 

<h2>Step 1: Installing Git</h2>

To start, you will need to download Git. If you have a Windows computer, click <a href=https://git-scm.com/download/win">here</a>. On macOS, open up OSX Terminal and type <code>git --version<code>, and you will be prompted to install it if it was not already. 

<h2>Step 2: Create a GitHub repository</h2>

Now, you'll need to be sure you have a Github account. Once you do, go to <a href="github.com">the GitHub website</a> and choose "Start a project".
From here, you will find yourself entering the basic information for your repository. The name, the owner, whether or not the project is publicly accessible, etc. Once all that is filmed out, click "Create repository".

<h2>Step 3: Setting up the Repository</h2>

You are now met with four options on how you'd like to create your repository. For the sake of creating a new repository using Git, we want to use the second option, "Create a new repository on the command line". 

<h2>Step 4: Using the terminal</h2>

Save this page for later and open up your terminal (Windows Command Prompt on Windows or OS X Terminal on Macintosh). First, type in the word "git", and hit enter, just to make sure it installed correctly. From there, it's time to create the folder to host your repository. Type <code>mkdir folderName</code>, where folderName is the name of your repository. This will create a folder (or, director) with that name. To enter that folder, type <code>cd folerName</code>.
